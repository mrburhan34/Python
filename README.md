These Projects are coded by Syed Saqib Burhanuddin I'm currently 14 years old and studying in 9th grade. I'm interested in programming very much! I would like to make my career in this field. I hold I won't lose this repo because these projects are very valuable and memorable to me. I built few small websites too but now I'm not interested in Web-Development. from 15 days I'm trying learn Python In 15 days I built 11 projects. Frankly I don't like to make my career on Web-Development because I think Artificial Intelligence is good enough to build a cool websites. I dream is to build one Artificial Intelligence using Python. I took a challenge to complete Python Course in one month, Today's date is 1-1-2025 and today is New Year my challenge has deadend on 29-1-2025 it is also mentioned in my MS Calender and MS To-Do-List actually i like UI of Microsoft Apps.
